      "text": "Hate speech is speech that offends, threatens, or insults individuals or groups on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, disability, or other traits. Contrary to popular belief, hate speech is not itself an unprotected category of speech under the First Amendment. An individual could say something that constitutes hate speech and also constitutes unprotected speech (a “true threat” for instance), but an individual could also say something that constitutes hate speech and is protected under the First Amendment. As a result, hate speech is not often used as a category in policies addressing the First Amendment.",
